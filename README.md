<h3>language that i've use</h3>

**Reason to create this website**

*It is come from my pain point which is when i'm in the situation that want to go to someplaces and my habit is to plan before the day i will go. For example if i want to go to Siam Center, i need to research where it is, how do i go, what is the best route to go, how much i'm gonna spend if i go that route etc. Actually google's map have this feature but it didn't tell me how much i'm gonna spend(It is actually tell only the toll). So that's why i make this website*

**Progress of this website(how do i do this website)**

- I'm make HTML template first (take me ~1 week)
- Research about Google's map API and find out i can't make a fancy map just because i didn't have credit card ðŸ˜­ (take me ~2-3 weeks because i'm being procastinate)
- Find out that the deadline to send final project is coming (take me ~30 sec)
- Working on back-end such as implementing Google's map API, Create user database, Create simple table of the public transportation price in thailand etc. (take me ~1-2 weeks)
- Reserch on the page transition, animation etc. And implementing it (take me ~4 days)
- Finally finish ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

**How to use**

- Simply, You can register on the website if you didn't already done it or if you have the account already just login to the website
- Use navbar to navigate to the WhereTo page.
- Select the places that you want to go then click *HowTo!* button
- That's it! you will see a map and the marker which mark where do you live and the destination of the places that you will go. Under the map you wil see the cost of the route and some explanation about how to travel to that places.

**Conclusion and what i want to say about this course**

*I've learned so much in this project especially about Google's map API and some front-end things. I just want to say **_thank you_** so much for whose making this course and thank you to the community especially on discord(lol) that not give the answer but say something that sparkle my brain(lmao)*
